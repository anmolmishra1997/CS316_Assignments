Register Allocation - It is done to speed up the access of particular variables which are frequently used. 
Mapping of values into variables. Keep the value in a register. Instead of accessing from memory, access from register.

Two tpyes -
1. Register Allocation -  
	Global Register Allocation - Throughout the execution, we would like to keep the value in register as long as possible. Limited registers, hence a challenge to maintain this allocation. 
	Done using graph coloring problem. Colors are registers, nodes are registers, interference are edges. ()
	Other strategies which require the length of time etc. are more complicated and not covered in our course.

	Local Register Allocation - Assigning registers to temporary variables. 

2. Function Call Resolution -

	Caller and callee have assigned roles.
	Fixed roles.
	Mentioned in the notes.
